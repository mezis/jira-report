# jira-report

Export a list of completed tickets from Jira, with their start date, completion
date, and estimate.

The purpose is to allow proper velocity calculation (Jira's per-sprint
calculation being insufficient, and unworkable in a Kanban-style process).

### Installation

Clone this repo.

### Configuration

    git config jira.user <username>
    git config jira.password <password>
    git config jira.site <url>

### Usage

    ./report.rb <project key>...

Produces `report.csv`. Use your favourite spreadsheet tool from there.
